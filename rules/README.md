# Add new rules here

### backend.txt & frontend.txt

These files contains the PHP and JS/HTML malware signatures in two forms:
 - String literals (without backslash escaping)
 - Regexes (enclosed in / / characters)
 
Regex is slower! So literals are preferred.

### burner-domains.txt

Burner domains are short-lived domains, registered by criminals (under a phony name).
Don't put legitimate domains here, even if they contain malware.

These domains will get processed to various signatures, using the most
common obfuscation techniques. 

### custom.yar

Complex rules go here, they are added as-is during the build process of `build/all-confirmed.yar`. 

Adding rules here should be a last resort, as complex rules cannot be converted into `grep` patterns, and as such, are not usable to the majority of people (who use grep only).

### suspicious.yar

This project values accuracy over coverage. As such, signatures that yield false positives are not part of the main rules. However, you can add rules for testing. Also consider rules that are heuristic of nature (instead of identifying) to the [NBS malware scanner](https://github.com/nbs-system/php-malware-finder), which values coverage over accuracy.
